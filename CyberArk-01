What is CyberArk ?
==================
   CyberArk is a cybersecurity company that provides solutions for managing privileged access, which is the access granted to accounts that have elevated permissions. 
   These accounts are often targeted by attackers because they hold the keys to an organization's most sensitive information and critical systems. 
   CyberArk's offerings are designed to protect these privileged accounts, credentials, and secrets.

What is cyberark digital vault ?
================================
   The CyberArk Digital Vault is the core of CyberArk's Privileged Access Security (PAS) solution.
   It is a secure, hardened environment where privileged credentials, session recordings, and other sensitive information are stored.
   The Digital Vault uses multiple layers of security to protect this data, including encryption, access controls, and network isolation.

Security Layers of CyberArk ?
=============================
   CyberArk employs several security layers to ensure the protection and integrity of privileged accounts and credentials:
   Encryption:
   -----------
     Data-at-Rest Encryption: The data stored in the Digital Vault is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
     Data-in-Transit Encryption: All data transmitted between the CyberArk components and the Digital Vault is encrypted to prevent interception and tampering.
   Authentication:
   ---------------
     Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Users must provide multiple forms of verification before gaining access to the Digital Vault, enhancing security by requiring more than just a password.
     Single Sign-On (SSO): Streamlines the authentication process while maintaining security through centralized identity providers.
   Access Controls:
   ----------------
     Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to resources within the Digital Vault is granted based on the user's role, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
     Granular Access Policies: Fine-tuned policies control who can access what data and perform which actions, based on user roles, time of day, and other factors.
   Audit and Monitoring:
   ---------------------
     Session Recording: All privileged sessions can be recorded for audit purposes, providing a detailed record of user activities.
     Audit Logs: Comprehensive logs of all actions performed within the Digital Vault are maintained, allowing for thorough review and forensic analysis.
   Network Security:
   -----------------
     Network Segmentation: The Digital Vault is isolated from other network segments to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential for lateral movement by attackers.
     Firewall and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): These systems are used to monitor and protect the network infrastructure surrounding the Digital Vault.
   Disaster Recovery:
  -----------------
     High Availability and Redundancy: The Digital Vault can be configured for high availability with redundant systems to ensure continuous operation and quick recovery in case of failure.
     Regular Backups: Data in the Digital Vault is regularly backed up to enable restoration in case of data loss or corruption.
